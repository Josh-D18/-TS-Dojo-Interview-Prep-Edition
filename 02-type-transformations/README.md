# ðŸ§¬ 02 â€“ Type Transformations

Day 2 of the dojo: bending the type system until it sings.

## Focus

- Union wrangling
- Conditional logic at the type level
- Key remapping and string literal transformation
- Mastering `infer` like a compiler whisperer

## Mental Models

1. **Unions** are like lists â€” you filter, map, and merge them.
2. **Conditionals** are logic gates for types.
3. **Mapped types** are your loops.
4. **Template literals** let you _generate_ string-based types dynamically.
5. **Infer** is your secret agent â€” let it gather info for you.

## Challenges

- Rebuild Extract, Exclude, and NonNullable manually.
- Use a template literal to autogenerate API endpoint names.
- Write a mapped type that makes all function properties readonly.

> ðŸ’¬ Pro tip: if you can explain why a type distributes, you already sound senior.
