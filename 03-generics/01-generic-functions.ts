// üß© Goal: Master reusable function logic that adapts to types dynamically.

// 1Ô∏è‚É£ Basic identity challenge
// Write a function that returns whatever it receives ‚Äî but *preserves* the type.

// 2Ô∏è‚É£ Swap function
// Build a function that swaps the positions of two items in a tuple ‚Äî with type inference.

// 3Ô∏è‚É£ Array element extractor
// Build a function that takes an array and returns its first element, fully typed.

// 4Ô∏è‚É£ MapKeys challenge
// Create a function that takes an object and returns an array of its keys (typed, not just string[]).

// 5Ô∏è‚É£ Constraint twist
// Make a function that only works on arrays with items that have an `id: string` property.

// ‚ùìInterview follow-up thought: how would you *narrow* generic inference when TypeScript infers too broadly?
