# 🧩 Day 3 — Generics Mastery

> “Generics are not about making code reusable — they’re about making abstractions precise.”

## 📘 What You’ll Learn

- Writing reusable functions and data structures
- Constraining generic parameters to control inference
- Recreating built-in utility types
- Function overloads and inference refinement
- Designing abstract, type-safe architectures

## 💥 Mindset

Generics are mental jiu-jitsu — it’s about _control through flexibility_.  
When everything feels abstract and floaty, ask yourself:

> “What do I actually want to _guarantee_ about this type?”

That’s your constraint. Everything else is freedom.

## 🧗 Challenge Progression

| Stage | Focus              | Skill                         |
| ----- | ------------------ | ----------------------------- |
| 1     | Generic Functions  | Inference and flexibility     |
| 2     | Constraints        | Type control                  |
| 3     | Utility Types      | Deep structural reasoning     |
| 4     | Function Overloads | Conditional logic + inference |
| 5     | Abstractions       | Systems thinking              |

## 🎯 Interview Triggers

- "How would you make this function type-safe without losing flexibility?"
- "How do you build your own version of Pick or Omit?"
- "Why does TypeScript sometimes infer `unknown` or `any` here?"
- "What’s the difference between `extends` as constraint vs conditional?"
