# ⚛️ Day 5 — Advanced React + TypeScript

> “This is where types meet components, and abstractions meet real UI.”

## 🧠 What You’ll Learn

- Typed components, hooks, and contexts
- Type-safe React patterns: forwardRef, HOCs, polymorphism
- Using generics with components and hooks
- Discriminated unions for props
- Handling context safely and dynamically

## 💥 Core Ideas

TypeScript in React isn’t about annotation — it’s about _communication_.
Every prop type you define is a **contract** between you and future you (or your team).

| Concept            | Real-World Use        |
| ------------------ | --------------------- |
| Generic Components | Reusable UI blocks    |
| Typed Hooks        | Safer async logic     |
| Context Typing     | Global state          |
| Union Props        | Flexible APIs         |
| ForwardRef         | Composable primitives |

## 🧗 Challenge Flow

| Stage | Focus            | Skill                   |
| ----- | ---------------- | ----------------------- |
| 1     | Typed Components | Props design            |
| 2     | Hooks            | Inference mastery       |
| 3     | Generic Props    | Reusable architecture   |
| 4     | Context          | State abstraction       |
| 5     | Patterns         | Advanced design fluency |

## 🧩 Interview Prompts

- “How do you type a generic component that accepts custom render logic?”
- “How do you type React context without `as` assertions?”
- “Why might React.FC be considered harmful?”
- “What happens when you wrap a typed component in an HOC?”

## 🚀 Final Challenge

Build a **fully typed Todo Dashboard** with:

- A generic `<List<T>>` for todos
- A `useLocalStorage<T>` hook
- Typed context for auth + settings
- A builder pattern for filters (from Day 4)

Integrate your learning from _every single dojo file._
